<?php
if ($_SERVER["REQUEST_METHOD"] == "POST") {
  $name = strip_tags(trim($_POST["name"]));
  $email = filter_var(trim($_POST["email"]), FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL);
  $message = trim($_POST["message"]);

  $to = "yourname@example.com";

Replace "yourname@example.com" with your real email address.

ðŸš¨ Important Notes:
This works only if your hosting supports PHP and has mail() enabled.

If you're using free hosting, email functions might be disabled.

For Gmail or business-level email delivery, it's better to use authenticated SMTP (more secure) â€” I can help with that if you want.

Would you like to use SMTP for better reliability (e.g. emails landing in inbox, not spam)?
